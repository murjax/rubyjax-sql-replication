----- Setup steps -----
1. Check replication connections allowed via md5 in pg_hba.conf on both servers.
2. Update these settings in postgresql.conf on both servers
  wal_level = logical
  max_wal_senders = 10
  max_replication_losts = 10
3. Restart servers
4. Create databases and schemas on both servers.
5. Alter tables with replica identity full on primary.
6. Create publication on primary (use new database).
7. Create subscription on replica (use new database).

----- Setup commands -----
5. ALTER TABLE users REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
6. CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR ALL TABLES;
7. CREATE SUBSCRIPTION replica_subscription CONNECTION 'dbname=pizza_deliveries host=primary_db user=postgres password=postgres' PUBLICATION my_publication;

----- Schema change steps -----
1. Delete subscriptions and replications from replica.
2. Delete replication slot from primary.
3. Delete publication from primary.
4. Apply schema changes to both databases separately.
5. Create publication on primary.
6. Create subscription on replica.

----- Replication Teardown steps -----
1. Delete subscriptions and replications from replica.
2. Delete replication slot from primary.
3. Delete publication from primary.

----- Replication Teardown commands -----
1.
  DELETE FROM pg_subscription;
  DELETE FROM pg_subscription_rel;
  DELETE FROM pg_replication_origin;
2. SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('replica_subscription');
3. DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS my_publication;

----- Full teradown steps -----
1. Delete subscriptions and replications from replica.
2. Delete replication slot from primary.

----- Setup steps -----
1. Set bind-address and server-id on primary and replica.
   Bind address allows other server to be seen externally. Server ID must be unique on each server.
2. Set log-bin file location on both servers.
3. Set relay-log file on replica.
4. Set gtid-mode=ON and enforce-gtid-consistency=ON on both servers.
5. Set log-replica-updates=ON and skip-replica-start=ON on replica.
6. Create replication user on primary. Must use sha256_password.
7. Grant replication slave to replication user. Flush privileges after.
8. Change replication source on replica. Set source auto position to 1.
9. Restart servers.
10. Start replica on replica.
11. Create database on primary.

----- Setup commands -----
6. CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
7. GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
8. CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
   SOURCE_HOST='primary_db',
   SOURCE_PORT=3306,
   SOURCE_USER='replica_user',
   SOURCE_PASSWORD='password',
   SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1;
10. START REPLICA;

----- Teardown steps -----
1. Stop replica.
2. Drop database on replica.
3. Drop database on primary.
4. Drop replica user on primary.
5. Stop servers.

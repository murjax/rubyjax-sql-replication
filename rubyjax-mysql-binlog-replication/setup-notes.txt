----- Setup steps -----
1. Set bind-address and server-id on primary and replica.
   Bind address allows other server to be seen externally. Server ID must be unique on each server.
2. Create replication user on primary. Must use sha256_password.
3. Grant replication slave to replication user. Flush privileges after.
4. Obtain binary log coordinates from primary.
5. Change replication source on replica. Specify binary log file and position from last step.
6. Restart servers.
7. Start replica on replica.
8. Create database on primary.

----- Setup commands -----
2. CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
3. GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
4. SHOW BINARY LOG STATUS
5. CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
   SOURCE_HOST='primary_db',
   SOURCE_PORT=3306,
   SOURCE_USER='replica_user',
   SOURCE_PASSWORD='password',
   SOURCE_LOG_FILE='binlog.000002',
   SOURCE_LOG_POS=856;
6. START REPLICA;

----- Teardown steps -----
1. Stop replica.
2. Drop database on replica.
3. Drop database on primary.
4. Drop replica user on primary.
5. Stop servers.
